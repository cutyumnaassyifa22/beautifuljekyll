Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start?  
If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out.  
If I ended a relationship with a woman who made me feel bad, I wouldn’t be considered weak.  
I would be considered brave and wise.  

Why then, do we choose to stay in the jobs, careers, and relationships that cause us to feel bad day after day?  
Is it loyalty? Guilt? Fear?  
Who are we trying to please by walking in a path that clearly doesn’t make us feel alive?  
The same voice that tells us “to stay” is the same voice that will greet us at our deathbed with regret if we don’t listen to it now.  

Your voice deserves to be heard and it deserves to be listened to.

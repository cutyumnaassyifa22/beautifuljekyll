Excerpt from Soulshaping by Jeff Brown

By Jeff Brown and Dean Attali

This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.
I strongly encourage you to take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown –
it’ll teach you how to transform regular text into **bold** / *italics* / `tables` / etc.

I also encourage you to look at the code that generates this site.
